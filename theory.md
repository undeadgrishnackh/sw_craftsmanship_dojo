The SW Craftsmanship dojo foster the balance between theory and practice. A student must study and then practice these topics:

* The Pomodoro technique
* Test Driven Development (TDD): 3 laws plus red/green/refactor loop
* OOD (Object-Oriented Design)
* UML basics
* Refactoring
* SOLID principles
* Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)
* Product Ownership: SCRUM (one man) vs XP (one team)
