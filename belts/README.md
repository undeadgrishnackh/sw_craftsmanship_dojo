The SW Craftsmanship dojo divides the learning experience into levels (belts)
like in judo.

## Katas

The SW Craftsmanship dojo ðŸ¥‹ follows the coding dojo movement and the
[Samman coaching](https://sammancoaching.org/) community. We try to stay
connected with it by leveraging
["Emily Bache's job"](https://github.com/emilybache?tab=repositories).
