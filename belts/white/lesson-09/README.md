# ⚪️ White Belt ⚪️ Lesson 9: Refactor like a boy scout! Part II

## 📚 Homework showcase

- Daily kata awareness moment --> showcase
- 🙋‍♂️ Did you complete a kata a day?
- 🙋‍♂️ Is your code like well-written prose?
- 🙋‍♂️ Do you collect and tame TechDebt?

## 👨🏻‍🏫 Recap

- 🤔 What do you think about Refactoring?
- 🤔 Why the code should be readable?

## 🏋️ Practice: Solve a new kata as a Boy Scout

- KATA:
  - New kata with many edge cases
    - Backlog: incremental US with UAT
    - Kata Scaffolding: git init + test dependencies + dummy tests + watcher
      loop
    - Let's incrementally code (🔴Red/🟢Green/♻️Refactor):
      - 🧪 Unit test loop: atomic behaviors + Guardians
      - 🧩 Component & 🔌 Integration test loop: join atomic behaviors
      - 🤝 E2E test loop: Simulate the user expectation with examples
    - 🤔 Look at your code. Is it more clean and user-centric?
  - 👀 Observations:
    - Kata Scaffolding: 🤔 Isn't it tedious to do the same init stuff for all
      the kata you have done so far?

## 📚 Homework

1. 5+ katas with notes.
2. Improve your daily drill:
   - Only 1 🍅 Pomodoro
   - Improve your backlog with incremental US
   - Improve your US with simple UAT
   - Use the 📝 properly to create an incremental flow
   - Commit at every 🔴Red/🟢Green/♻️Refactor
   - After every green scenario, write the technical debt into a file
     `TECHDEBT.md`
   - Commit code, notes, and tech debt in git at every cycle
   - Read your code 📖 and measure how many WTF moments you're gonna enjoy 😲
   - Apply the refactor `Boy Scout rule`
   - Rate your code as it's a best-seller book... 5⭐️ or 🗑️?
