# Theory

The SW Craftsmanship dojo foster the balance between theory and practice. A student must study and then practice these topics:

* The Pomodoro technique
* Test Driven Development (TDD): 3 laws plus red/green/refactor loop
* OOD (Object-Oriented Design)
* UML basics
* Refactoring
* SOLID principles
* Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)
* Product Ownership: SCRUM (one man) vs XP (one team)

# the fll library

After almost 3 years and a half of experiments, and thanks to my XPeppers' friend and expecially to Pietro di Bello, ["HERE is Starway to Orion"](https://github.com/xpeppers/starway-to-orione). It's the "library" we used to train developers to become craftsmen.
