## 📚 Theory and Immediate 🏋️ Practice: Quality Gate on Remote

> 👨🏻‍🏫 A CI tool is a platform that automates the process of building, testing,
> and publishing your software. CI tools integrate with your version control
> system so they can fetch the latest changes from your repository.

- 📚 Continuous Integration Platforms:
  - ⛓️ [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io)
  - ⛓️ [Travis](https://www.travis-ci.com)
  - ⛓️ [CircleCI](https://circleci.com)
  - ⛓️
    [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/pipelines/)
  - etc.
- 📚 Version control on steroids:
  - 🏗️ [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
  - 🏗️
    [GitLab Pipelines](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/continuous-integration/)
- 🏋🏻‍♂️ Migrate your Quality Gates in the CB phase (Continuos Build)
  - 1️⃣ Linter
  - 2️⃣ CheckStyle
  - 3️⃣ Conventional Commit

## 📚 Homework

1. 5+ katas with notes.
2. Improve your daily drill:
   - Only 1 🍅 Pomodoro
   - Use the 📝 properly
   - Organize the `BACKLOG.md` by ATDD and incremental complexity
   - Focus on improving your tests using 🤷‍♂️ DUMMIES and 🎭 STUBS
   - 👉 _Conventional_ Commit at every 🔴Red/🟢Green/♻️Refactor
   - 👉 Reduce the Cyclomatic Complexity to <= 4
   - 👉 Local Quality Gate automation via git hooks
   - 👉 Remote Quality Gate in the CI Pipeline (CB phase)
   - Prioritize the technical debt into `TECHDEBT.md`
   - Apply the refactor _Boy Scout rule_
   - Keep a deeper clean code posture to let the architecture emerge
   - Check the _accidental complications_. Is it under control and close to
     ZERO?
   - Rate your code as it's a best-seller book... 5⭐️ or 🗑️?
