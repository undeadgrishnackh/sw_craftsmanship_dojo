# 🟡 Yellow Belt 🟡 Lesson 3: Graduation Exercise with Ddd Mini-Loop Part II

## 📚 Homework showcase

- Daily kata awareness moment --> showcase
- 🙋‍♂️ Did you observe the problem as a user?
- 🙋‍♂️ Are your notes now full of examples?
- 🙋‍♂️ Did you use the examples to create the tests?
- 🙋‍♂️ Did the time-lapse picture help you to structure the tests into incremental
  complexity?

## 🏋️ Practice: 🏁 Finish What We Started in the Last Session -- 4 x 🍅

⚜️ Recap from the last session:

- OutSide-In style driven by examples
  - Start from the user's perspective --> 📝 examples
  - Organize your examples --> ⏱️ use the timeline
  - Incrementally dive deeper into the technical details --> 🧪 complex >> 🤔
    complicated >> 👨‍💻 clear
  - Repeat until you have covered all the scenario

⏭️ Continue to add incremental complexity:

- 👍 Right examples: testing and coding is ✅
- 🧪 Complex example: testing and coding require 🔭 exploration
- ❌ Wrong examples: complexity spikes too high 🤯 (Cognitive overload)

## 📚 Homework

1. 5+ katas with notes.
2. Improve your daily drill:
   - Only 1 🍅 Pomodoro
   - Use the 📝 properly
   - 👉 Create the time-lapse picture and description
   - 👉 Organize the time-lapse in incremental complexity
   - Commit at every 🔴Red/🟢Green/♻️Refactor
   - After every green scenario, write the technical debt into a file
     `TECHDEBT.md`
   - Commit code, notes, and tech debt in git at every cycle
   - Apply the refactor _Boy Scout rule_
   - Rate your code as it's a best-seller book... 5⭐️ or 🗑️?
