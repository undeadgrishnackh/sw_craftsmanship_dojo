# The Software Craftsmanship Dojo

This project wants to foster the principle of the ["SW craftsmanship manifesto"](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org) via the emerging technique of applying the martial art dojo into software development.

## What is a martial art dojo?

A martial art dojo is a traditional training space where individuals learn and *practice* a martial arts. The term "dojo" originates from Japanese and translates to "place of the way" or "place of learning." In the dojo, martial arts practitioners engage in rigorous physical and mental training to develop their combat skills, discipline, and character.

Dojos typically follow a structured curriculum led by experienced instructors (sensei) who guide students through the learning process. The training sessions involve practicing specific techniques, forms, and sparring (controlled combat) with fellow students to gain proficiency in their chosen martial art. 

The practicing of specific techniques uses "kata" as a fundamental aspect of training. Kata is a Japanese term that refers to a "choreographed sequence of movements" or "techniques that are performed in a specific pattern". These sequences are designed to represent various combat scenarios and attacks.

## How does a martial art dojo can be used for software development purposes?

In the context of software development, the term "dojo" is used metaphorically to represent a learning environment or practice space where software development teams come together to enhance their skills, collaborate, and continuously improve their craft. This concept draws parallels between the disciplined and focused training in traditional martial arts dojos and the training and improvement efforts in the software development domain.

In a software development "dojo," the focus is on fostering a culture of continuous learning, collaboration, and mastery. Principle that are indeed part of the SW Craftsmanship manifesto published in 2009:

As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft:

- Not only working software, but also well-crafted software
- Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value
- Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals
- Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships

## The coding dojo handbook

Thanks to Emily Bache, in late 2013 was released the book "["The coding dojo handbook"](https://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook)" as a master piece to empower everyone to start their own dojos and to pursue for SW Craftsmanship, pride and fun in our work.

## a completely NEW learning path.

After almost 3 years and a half of experiments, and thanks to my XPeppers' friend and expecially to Pietro di Bello, it's publically available the "library" we used to train developers to become craftsmen. All the details in the theory section.
