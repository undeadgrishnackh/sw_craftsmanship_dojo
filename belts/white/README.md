# ⚪️ White Belt ⚪️

The White belt is the starting point for **most** students (_roughly 95%_) after
completing the assessment kata.

## White Belt in a nutshell

The White Belt signifies the beginning of the SW Craftsmanship Dojo journey,
where participants lay the foundation for their software development skills.
This level introduces essential concepts such as Test-Driven Development (TDD),
Unit Testing, Pair Programming, and effective use of Git and Terminal.
Participants learn to achieve comprehensive code coverage and understand the
Pyramid of Testing. The focus is cultivating clean code practices, refining code
through refactoring, and developing a solid understanding of domain vocabulary.
Ultimately, the primary objective is to enable habits of improved focus,
effective time management, and resilience against distractions, thus fostering
the development of self-discipline and unlocking more time for daily kata
practice.

## Skills to develop 🥋

- 1️⃣ Discipline (Daily kata)
- 2️⃣ Time and Focus management
- 3️⃣ TDD & Basic Clean Code
