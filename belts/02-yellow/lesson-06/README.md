# 🟡 Yellow Belt 🟡 Lesson 6: Emerging Architecture & Simple Design Part II

🏁 Finish what we started in the [last session](../lesson-05/README.md) about
emerging architecture:

- 0️⃣ - Overengineering (Confusion driven approach)
- 1️⃣ - 😱 Poor engineering (Development Shortcuts)
- 2️⃣ - 🤔 Brute Force approach (Discovery via Spikes)
- 3️⃣ - 🤩 Ergonomic design (clean architecture + clean code)

## 📚 Homework

1. 5+ katas with notes.
2. Improve your daily drill:
   - Only 1 🍅 Pomodoro
   - Use the 📝 properly
   - Create the time-lapse picture and description
   - 👉 Organize the time-lapse in incremental complexity >> `BACKLOG.md`
   - Commit at every 🔴Red/🟢Green/♻️Refactor
   - After every green scenario, write the technical debt into a file
     `TECHDEBT.md`
   - Commit code, notes, and tech debt in git at every cycle
   - Apply the refactor _Boy Scout rule_
   - 👉 Keep a deeper clean code posture to let the architecture emerge
   - 👉 Check the _accidental complications_. Is it under control and close to
     ZERO?
   - Rate your code as it's a best-seller book... 5⭐️ or 🗑️?
