# 🟡 Yellow Belt 🟡

After graduation, most candidates face the pressure of the emerging architecture
dilemma. They go into the problem and are overwhelmed by the complexity. Here
starts the Yellow belt journey: DDD - BDD - TDD

## Yellow Belt in a nutshell

Building on White Belt's foundations, we start shifting towards a user-centric
mindset.

### Skills to develop 🥋

- 1️⃣ Discipline (Daily kata)
- 2️⃣ Clean code intermediate
- 3️⃣ Architecture

### Capabilities 🏋️‍♀️

| :-- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.  | 🤕 The pain to create UAT and unit test - DDD observation |
| 2.  | 👌 ATDD (basic BDD)                                       |
| 3.  | 💎 Code quality - linter                                  |
| 4.  | 🤷‍♀️ git semantic                                           |
| 5.  | 🏗 Emerging OO - Event-driven architecture                |
| 6.  | 🤝 US Refinement negotiation                              |
| 7.  | 💸 `TECHDEBT.md`                                          |
| 8.  | ♻️ Intermediate refactor                                  |
|     | - Game: Read your code like a book                        |
|     | - Game: Extract until you can't anymore                   |
|     | - Kata vocabulary === test vocabulary === code vocabulary |
|     | - Source code as a well-written-prose                     |
|     | - Beyond readability, there is code understandability     |
|     | - Code complexity (cyclomatic)                            |
